  This function is used when moving trains FROM the main track. It takes
  two arguments: a train (i.e. a list of wagons) and a number n that represents
  the number of wagons to move. The wagons on the main track are in reverse order
  i.e. the first wagon in the list is in the leftmost position on the track.
  When youâ€™re asked to move two wagons to another track you should divide the train
  into two segments; the segment that should remain and the two wagons
  (to the right i.e. in the end of the list) that should be moved.

  For example:
    main([:a, :b, :c, :d], 3) = {0, [:a], [:b, :c, .d]}
    main([:a, :b, :c, :d], 5) = {1, [], [:a, :b, :c, .d]}
